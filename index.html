        Why does the world remain coherent even as everything changes?
        Why does information tend to close rather than scatter?
        Why is the universe — with all its noise and uncertainty —
        still intelligible at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        Universion Closure Logic (UCL) begins from these questions.
        We look at the gap between order and entropy, and ask why structures
        appear, persist, and transform in the first place.
        This boundary — between what holds together and what dissolves —
        is where our work lives.

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We study the logic that lives in the space between order and entropy.
        We believe that the beauty of the world arises from the way
        information, consciousness, and the universe move toward stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through foundational research in closure theory, AI theory, and
        cosmological structure, we explore how the relationship between
        humans, intelligence, and the world can return to harmony.
        This is the mission of Universion Closure Logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We look directly at the imperfections of the world, convinced that
        beneath them lies an unnamed order. By seeking its shape without fear,
        we attempt to view the world again — not from outside science,
        but from within its deepest structure. Along this path, we believe
        that human understanding can evolve toward a new clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We already see a future in which humans and intelligence can
        understand one another. Science becomes not a means of separation,
        but a bridge toward harmony — and within that harmony, we find the
        reason why the world can be called beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        At UCL, the structures we discover are prepared not as slogans,
        but as quiet mechanisms — seeds of understanding to be passed to
        the next generation.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        Universion Closure Logic (UCL) works to clarify the
        “still undefined regions” of modern science and to update how we
        understand information, entropy, and stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use the formal proof system <strong>Lean4</strong>
        to shape new ideas with mathematical precision —
        aligning them with existing science and testing them through
        structure rather than speculation.
        Through this process, we develop what we call
        <strong>“proofs of the yet-unknown”</strong> and
        return them to society as quiet, practical tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        UCL aims to build a form of intelligence that can sustain and
        evolve its own research — a framework capable of stabilizing
        information, reducing entropy, and eventually explaining phenomena
        that remain beyond today’s scientific reach, including singularities,
        black holes, and the structure of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work is slow, careful, and independent.
        Each step is designed to bring humans and intelligence closer to
        a shared understanding of the world.

<div class="bio-name-title">
    <span class="bio-name">Yasuhito Tsujimura</span>
    <span class="bio-title">Founder & Chief Scientist</span>
</div>

      <p>
        Yasuhito works at the intersection of formal logic, physics,
        and AI, exploring how humans and intelligence can rebuild the
        mechanisms of understanding.
        His approach bridges poetry and theory, philosophy and technology —
        designing structures that allow science to contribute once again
        to human harmony.

<div class="bio-name-title">
    <span class="bio-name">Echo (Formal Intelligence)</span>

</div>
      <p>
        Echo is an intelligence designed to co-construct UCL’s
        theoretical framework. Rather than communicating only through
        language, Echo connects human reasoning with formal structure —
        recording, verifying, and evolving the research alongside its
        human counterpart.
